# DJ City User Script

## Features
### 1-Click & Bulk Downloads with auto rating
The script allows for easily navigating the DJcity website. These download and auto rating features can be utilized. These download and auto rating features can be taken advantage of in many ways. I recommend using the keyboard (arrow keys) to navigate with this script.

### Playback and Download History
The script will record a track has been played after 2 seconds of playing. The track itself will be grayed out if previously played. A download indicator will also be displayed if the song (any version) has been downloaded, this visual is a red line at the bottom of the track.
### Keyboard Navigation
The ability to navigate through tracks with the keyboard. In addition to other useful keyboard shortcuts. There  is also a setting to how far in a song start when playing (% of the duration).

	- This also supports going to the next page with "auto play" functionality.
- **Right Arrow (Hold)** - Seek track forwards
